# Smart Irrigation System (Cisco Packet Tracer)

## Aim

To design and simulate a **smart irrigation system** that automates lawn sprinkling using water level sensors, IoT connectivity, and remote monitoring/control via a smartphone interface, optimizing water usage in a garden scenario.

## Problem Statement

Traditional irrigation systems often result in inefficient water usage due to manual operation and lack of real-time monitoring. This can lead to overwatering, underwatering, and increased maintenance efforts. There is a need for an automated, sensor-based smart irrigation solution that enables seamless water management, remote monitoring, and controlled irrigation to conserve water and improve plant health.

## Scope of the Solution

- Automated control of multiple lawn sprinklers based on real-time water level monitoring.
- IoT sensors (water level monitors) for feedback-based irrigation.
- Centralized control via a Home Gateway device.
- Remote access and system control through a smartphone, enabling monitoring and control from anywhere.
- Expandable framework for additional sensors and actuators for larger gardens/farms.

## Required Components

### IDE/Software
- **Cisco Packet Tracer** (for schematic design, IoT configuration, and simulation)

### Hardware (Simulated in Packet Tracer)
- Home Gateway (central IoT controller)
- Water Level Monitors (sensor nodes)
- Lawn Sprinklers (actuators)
- Smartphone (remote user interface)

## Simulated Circuit

**Simulation environment:** Cisco Packet Tracer

- Four Lawn Sprinkler nodes (sprinkler 1 to 4) arranged for full garden coverage.
- Two Water Level Monitors (labeled "water level 1" and "water level 2") to monitor soil moisture and water levels.
- Central Home Gateway (DLC100) connects all sensors and actuators.
- A smartphone using IoT connectivity for remote monitoring/control.
- Devices communicate over IoT protocols in Packet Tracer (e.g., MQTT/HTTP).
